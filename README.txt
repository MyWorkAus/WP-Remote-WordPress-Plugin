== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What if I want to back up my site to another destination?**

You can also store your backups on your own Amazon S3 or you can upload backups to your own server via FTP or SFTP.

**How do I restore my site from a backup?**

WP Remote does not provide an automated way to restore your site. We recommend downloading a copy of your backup, unzipping it and then uploading to your site's server via FTP/SSH. Database importing can be done via your PHPMyAdmin interface or a similar tool - Your database backup can be found in the root folder of your downloaded backup zip.
